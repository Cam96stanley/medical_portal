# Medical Portal

Currently under development. This is the backend to a medical portal, specifically for coordinating care between doctors and patients with chronic illness's. Patients will be able to track their vitals, medications, appointments, educate themselves on their conditions, and send reports to their care team for evaluation. This will allow care teams to keep up to date information to make any changes to their patients care plans all in one place.
